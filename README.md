## 01. Guessing Game Challenge

### Program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number.

  #### The rules are:
###### 1.If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
##### 2.On a player's first turn, if their guess is:
###### 2.1.within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
###### 2.1.further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
##### 3.On all subsequent turns, if a guess is:
###### 3.1.closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
###### 3.2.farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
##### 4.When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!

## 03. Tic Tac Toc game

#### Here are the requirements:

###### 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
###### The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
###### You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board
###### Feel free to use Google to help you figure anything out (but don't just Google "Tic Tac Toe in Python" otherwise you won't learn anything!) Keep in mind that this project can take anywhere between several hours to several days.
